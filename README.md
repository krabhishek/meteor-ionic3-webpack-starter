This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects with [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/) backend.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. You still need to install the dependencies (meteor-client-bundler). This is to quickly get you started to start building ionic and meteor apps!

### Install Meteor Client Bundle and create meteor-client

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g meteor-client-bundler
$ npm run bundle-meteor client 
```


### How to serve the app in development:

You will have to run the meteor server and Ionic serve together

```bash
$ npm run api
```
```bash
$ ionic serve
```

## How is this starter structured?

1) The node_modules folder between the server (api) and client (ionic) is symbolically linked
2) You can import any meteor liberary using import {  } from 'api/module'. The alias is defined in the webpack.config.js
3) Install any new npm module in the root of the project (that is where package.json is located). Any meteor package should be installed in the api directory (api directory the meteor project generated by meteor create)
