This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects with [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/) backend.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. You still need to install the dependencies (meteor-client-bundler). This is to quickly get you started to start building ionic and meteor apps!

### Install Meteor Client Bundle and create meteor-client

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g meteor-client-bundler
$ npm run bundle-meteor-client 
```


### How to serve the app in development:

Serve the backend
```bash
$ npm run api
```
Serve the frontend
```bash
$ ionic serve
```

## How is this starter structured?

1) The node_modules folder between the server (api) and client (ionic) is symbolically linked
2) The alias is defined in the webpack.config.js that will allow you to import all meteor dependencies. Example:
```javascript
import { SampleMeteorDependency } from 'api/fake-meteor-dependency'
```
3) Install any new npm module in the root of the project (that is where package.json is located). Any meteor package should be installed in the api directory (api directory the meteor project generated by meteor create)
4) The meteor-client is imported into src/app/main.ts to integrate meteor with ionic
